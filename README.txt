From renderer.h you are able to change if you want to use Single Pass or Multi Pass using light_mode.
Also, in the screenshots folder there are 3 pictures showing multi and single pass with the alpha sorting.

In the shader_atlas.txt there are the phong equation for the three lights and a try out using other textures.

Shadowmaps does not work correctly, but it is implemented for both spot and directional lights in Multi Pass.
